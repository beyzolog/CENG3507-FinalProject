CENG 3507 : Web Development Final Project Report 

Introduction
In this project, I aim to develop a web-based management system for a factory that buys, categorizes, and sells blueberries. 

1. Supplier Management Module
I created a module to store farmer details like ID, name, and contact information. It also records purchases from farmers and calculates the total cost.

2. Product Categorization and Packaging Module
I developed a system to sort blueberries into seven packaging sizes, each with specific weights and prices. This helps the factory organize products for sale.

3. Sales Management Module
This module allows the factory to record customer orders, calculate total sales, and track revenue. I also added features to search and filter orders.

Financial Analysis Module and Inventory Management Module: I had difficulty implementing the Financial Analysis Module and the Inventory Management Module. However, I plan to improve these parts after receiving the necessary feedback.

Technical Implementation:
This project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project allowed me to develop a functional system for managing suppliers, product categorization, and sales. Although some modules still need improvement, I am confident that with further adjustments, the system will meet the factory's needs effectively. This project helped me improve my web development skills and gain valuable experience in building real-world applications.
